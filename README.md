# what is devops
DevOps is not a software also It is not a technology. It is a Methodology. There are three methodology, Waterfall Methodology, Agile Methodology and Devops

So DevOps is improvement of Agile Methodology.

DevOps is combination of two words i.e. development and operation.

DevOps is Software Development approach which involves Continuous Development, Continuous Testing, Continuous Integration and Continuous Monitoring of the software throughout its development lifecycle.

# what is Methodology:

A project management methodology is like an instructional manual or guide to effectively oversee completion of the project. 
A project team must have a set of defined processes to follow to initiate, plan, and, execute the project. 
Common project management methodologies include waterfall, agile, and DevOps

# Waterfall Model:

The Waterfall Model is a traditional software development methodology that follows a linear and sequential approach.
It consists of several distinct phases, and each phase must be completed before moving on to the next.

# Advantages of waterfall model:
## Stability in Project Scope:

The project scope remains relatively constant, allowing for early determination of costs and timelines. This stability is beneficial for project planning and budgeting.

## Cost-Effective Design Changes:

Completing a full design early in the project minimizes changes to systems. This helps in keeping the cost and effort required to fix or alter designs at a minimum, as modifications are less likely to occur.

## Structured Project Approach:

The Waterfall model provides a structured and sequential approach to project development. This clarity ensures that everyone involved understands what tasks need to be performed and when, facilitating effective planning and execution.

## Effective Time Planning for SMEs:

Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) can efficiently plan their time over the fixed project duration due to the well-defined stages and timeline. This predictability contributes to better resource management.

## Documentation for Knowledge Transfer:

Detailed documentation and designs accompany each phase of the Waterfall model. This documentation serves as a valuable resource, allowing the project to continue smoothly even if key team members are replaced or reassigned.

# Disadvantages of waterfall model:

## Limited Flexibility for Changes:

One of the major drawbacks is the lack of flexibility once the project has started. Changes in requirements or design are challenging to implement once a phase has been completed, potentially leading to an unsatisfactory end product if initial requirements were not well-defined.

## Late Client Feedback:

Client or user feedback is typically gathered late in the process, usually after the entire system has been developed. This can result in situations where client expectations are not fully met, as changes based on feedback are challenging to incorporate in the later stages of development.

## Long Delivery Time:

The Waterfall model follows a sequential approach, completing one phase before moving to the next. This can lead to longer delivery times, especially for large and complex projects, as each phase must be fully completed before proceeding to the next.

## Risk of Ambiguous Requirements:

In the initial stages, if requirements are not thoroughly defined or are ambiguous, it can lead to misunderstandings and misinterpretations. This may result in a final product that does not meet the actual needs of the users.

## High Dependency on Initial Documentation:

The success of the Waterfall model heavily relies on comprehensive documentation. If the initial documentation is incomplete or inaccurate, it can lead to misunderstandings and errors throughout the project lifecycle.

## Inefficient for Large Projects:

For large and complex projects, the Waterfall model may not be the most efficient choice. The lengthy development process may result in delayed detection of issues, making it challenging to address them in a timely manner.

## Limited Customer Involvement:

Customers are typically involved at the beginning and end of the project, with limited interaction during the development phases. This reduced customer involvement may lead to a final product that does not fully align with customer expectations.

## Not Suitable for Evolving Requirements:

In dynamic environments where requirements are likely to change, the Waterfall model may not be the best fit. It does not handle evolving or uncertain requirements well, as changes are difficult to accommodate once the project is in progress
