# what is devops
DevOps is not a software also It is not a technology. It is a Methodology. There are three methodology, Waterfall Methodology, Agile Methodology and Devops

So DevOps is improvement of Agile Methodology.

DevOps is combination of two words i.e. development and operation.

DevOps is Software Development approach which involves Continuous Development, Continuous Testing, Continuous Integration and Continuous Monitoring of the software throughout its development lifecycle.

# what is Methodology:

A project management methodology is like an instructional manual or guide to effectively oversee completion of the project. 
A project team must have a set of defined processes to follow to initiate, plan, and, execute the project. 
Common project management methodologies include waterfall, agile, and DevOps

# Waterfall Model:

The Waterfall Model is a traditional software development methodology that follows a linear and sequential approach.
It consists of several distinct phases, and each phase must be completed before moving on to the next.

# Architecture of waterfall model:

# Advantages of waterfall model:
## Stability in Project Scope:

The project scope remains relatively constant, allowing for early determination of costs and timelines. This stability is beneficial for project planning and budgeting.

## Cost-Effective Design Changes:

Completing a full design early in the project minimizes changes to systems. This helps in keeping the cost and effort required to fix or alter designs at a minimum, as modifications are less likely to occur.

## Structured Project Approach:

The Waterfall model provides a structured and sequential approach to project development. This clarity ensures that everyone involved understands what tasks need to be performed and when, facilitating effective planning and execution.

## Effective Time Planning for SMEs:

Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) can efficiently plan their time over the fixed project duration due to the well-defined stages and timeline. This predictability contributes to better resource management.

## Documentation for Knowledge Transfer:

Detailed documentation and designs accompany each phase of the Waterfall model. This documentation serves as a valuable resource, allowing the project to continue smoothly even if key team members are replaced or reassigned.
